📉 Time Series Analysis using Python
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs time series analysis using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, and others. The goal is to explore, visualize, and model temporal data for forecasting and trend analysis.

🧪 Features
1. Data loading and parsing with date-time index
2. Time series visualization (line plots, decomposition)
3. Trend, seasonality, and noise analysis
4. Stationarity checks (ADF Test)
5. Forecasting with models like ARIMA (if used)
